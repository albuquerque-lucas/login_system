# PHP Login System
### Showcase My Secure Login Skills

Hello! Welcome to my PHP Login System project. This project aims to demonstrate my abilities in creating a secure login system using PHP, MySQL, and HTML. It's not a serious commercial project, but rather a personal endeavor to showcase my skills and have a bit of fun along the way! üòÑ

## Inspiration
The idea for the logic and construction of this project was inspired by an article called "Improved Persistent Login Cookie Best Practice." Please note that the link is currently unavailable.

## Technologies Used
- PHP: The language that powers the server-side scripting and login system.
- PDO: PHP Data Objects, a database abstraction layer for accessing databases.
- MySQL: The chosen database management system to store user data securely.
- HTML: Used to create the user interface for registration, login, and task management.

## Installation
‚öôÔ∏è To get started with the PHP Login System, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have PHP version 8.2 or higher installed on your machine and the `mysql_pdo` extension enabled.
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/php-login-system.git`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd php-login-system`
4. Install the necessary dependencies: `composer install`
5. Start a local server: `php -S localhost:port`
6. Access the application in your browser: [http://localhost:port](http://localhost:port)

**Note**: Before running the application, ensure that you have a MySQL server running and properly configured. Update the database connection details in the project files, such as `login_system/assets/infrastructure/DatabaseConnection.php`, to match your MySQL server settings.

## Features
‚ú® The PHP Login System comes with the following features to showcase my login skills:

- User Registration: Create a new user account securely.
- Login: Log in to your account with proper authentication.
- Logout: End your session and say goodbye for now.
- Task Management: (Work in progress) Add and remove tasks from the main interface.

## Contributions
üôå Contributions, suggestions, and ideas are more than welcome! If you'd like to contribute to the project, here's what you can do:

- Open an issue and share your cool ideas or the problems you'd like to tackle.
- Fork the repository and create a branch with a descriptive name, like `git checkout -b your-branch-name`.
- Implement your changes in your forked repository.
- Send me a pull request with a detailed description of what you did.
- It's my turn to review and provide feedback. Let's make this project even better together! üëê

## Next Steps
üîú In the future, I plan to continue working on integrating a task tracking system with the login system. I'm open to suggestions and ideas on how to improve and expand the project. So, feel free to share your thoughts!

That's it! This PHP Login System project represents my personal journey to demonstrate my login skills and have a bit of coding fun. If you have any questions or need assistance, please feel free to reach out. üòä

Happy coding and stay secure! üîí‚ú®
